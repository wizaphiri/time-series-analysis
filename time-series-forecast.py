# basic time series analysis with ARIMA, starting with Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    # Visualize the Data: Plot the time series to identify patterns, trends, and seasonality.
    # Stationarity Check (Non-stationary data must be differenced to remove trends or seasonality)


# use ARIMA

# Model Estimation
    # Fit the ARIMA model using the identified parameters (𝑝,𝑑,𝑞) and the historical data with statsmodels lib

# Forecasting
    # Generate future values based on the fitted model for the desired forecast horizon.
    # Provide confidence intervals to quantify uncertainty in the predictions

# Model Evaluation
    # Compare forecasted values with actual values (if available) using metrics such as: MAE, MAPE, RMSE

# Model deployment
